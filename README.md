# Plant Health Classification
## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can classify plant images into two categories based on their health status: Healthy and Unhealthy. This binary classification task is a practical application of concepts learned in the Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning course. The project provides an opportunity to implement, train, and evaluate a neural network model capable of accurately predicting the health status of plants from images.
## Project Overview
In this project, you'll work with a dataset of plant images, where each image is labeled according to the plant's health condition. The goal is to build a classifier that can distinguish between healthy and unhealthy plants, leveraging deep learning techniques.
## Dataset Details
The dataset used for this project is organized as follows:
- Image Size: 96x96 pixels
- Image Size: 96x96 pixels
- Color Space: RGB (3 channels)
- File Format: .npz
- Number of Classes: 2
- &ensp; Class Labels:
